> Get started with Python for data analytics

We assume no prior programming experience and that you want to
get productive as quickly as possible.

## Prerequisites

Your machine must have the following:

1. Python 3.10 or higher
1. VS Code
1. VS Code Extension: Python
1. Git (configured)

- **Spacing, Spelling, Capitalization**: With computers, these are critical. Always double-check!

---

## Verify and Update Default Python

In VS Code, open a terminal window (View / Terminal).
If macOS/Linux, change `python` to `python3` in the commands below.

```shell
git --version
python --version
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel
```

---

## Execute Project Scripts

With your repo folder open in VS Code, start exploring.

1. Open acquainted.py (or another .py file).
1. If VS Code prompts, install the recommended Python extension.
1. Check the Python Interpreter: On the bottom-left status bar, you might see a version of Python indicated (e.g., Python 3.10.x).
1. If not, click on the bottom status bar where it should show the Python version or might say "Select Python Interpreter".
1. From the dropdown, choose your default Python version.
1. Open a terminal via View / Terminal.
1. Execute each script - one at a time.
1. On macOS/Linux, change `python` to `python3` in the commands below.

```shell
python acquainted.py
python basic_expressions.py
python basic_functions.py
python circle_calc.py
python data_io.py
python easy_stats.py
```

Helpful hint: Hit the **up arrow** in the terminal to get the last command. Edit as needed and hit return.

## Read and Modify Python Scripts

Read each script in alphabetical order.

1. Each project script has a .py file extension.
1. In the Explorer, click each script to open it in the editor.
1. Read the script.
1. You do NOT need to fully understand the code.
1. Instead, see which parts you can figure out.
1. By the end of the course, these will be very familiar.

Try the TODOs

1. When you see a TODO comment, try to do what it suggests.
1. Treat these as mini puzzles. Creating small syntax errors and fixing them are a great way to learn.
1. Want to see them all? In VS Code, use Edit / Find in Files and search for "TODO".
1. Want an extension to make it more fun? Try [TODO Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree).

Customize these project scripts.

1. Edit the author to your name.
1. Add / remove comments as you like.
1. Try new things!
1. Always run the scripts after making changes. Fix errors as they arise.

## Sync to GitHub

If things still work - sync the code back up to GitHub where it's safe.

1. Use VS Code's "Source Control" icon (on the left).
1. Add a commit message, e.g., "TODO 1".
1. Choose "Commit and Push" to sync to GitHub.

## Update README.md

Enhance this README.md as you progress. It uses Markdown, a simple and easy markup language.
